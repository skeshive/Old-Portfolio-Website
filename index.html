                            the client at the end of the semester. This semester, we will be working on building a model that accurately predicts the time a bus
                            will arrive at a particular bus stop using machine learning on the data we collected last semester. </div>

                          backend and developed a SQL database for storing information. I later worked full stack to help design the Admin page in which the admin
                          can write blog posts, change pictures, and add opportunities. The site will be live after we obtain the necessary data from the

                            my club at divisional meetings, presiding over general meetings, overseeing the publication of at least eight newsletters, and
                            appointing/training committee heads. Our club was also chosen to host Fall Rally, which is the largest gathering of NJ Key Clubbers
                            at Six Flags, Great Adventure. As a club, we designed character signs for each of the twenty nine district board members, decorated
                            the park, created a themed spirit stick, and oversaw registration for the event. Who I am now, and to a large extent, who I will be
                            as a college student and beyond, all stems from the lessons I learned as a Key Clubber. </div>
