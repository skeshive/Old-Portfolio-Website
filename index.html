                                online digital content analysts have to obtain relevant retail information of multiple products from several different systems, which wastes time and
                                presents misinformation. In order to alleviate this pain point, the Pricing Visibility Tool provides a consolidated system to view all relevant information.
                                I was fortunate enough to experience the full lifecycle implementation of this product in an Agile work environment. Working alongside software engineers,
                                product managers, and user experience designers, our team conducted research, interviews, prototyping, developing, and user validations. </div>

                                system of our own. Last semester, I joined the reporting tools subgroup, in which I learned how to analyze and present big data
                                to our clients. Using Tableau as our data reporting tool, my team developed graphs displaying bus headways, variations in arrival time,
                                and variations in departure time, which we then presented to the client at the end of the semester. This semester, we will be working on building a model that
                                accurately forecasts the time a bus will arrive at a particular bus stop using machine learning. </div>

                                handwriting, organized notes, and color coordination makes studying exciting, encouraging creativity in even the least stimulating
                                subjects. As a community, we all have different career goals but come together to share new study techniques and tools. Its
                                inspirational to see everyone working hard towards their individual goals. </div>

                              <div class="description"> Key Club, a community service organization that I was involved in since ninth grade, shaped my high school
                                career. As president of this organization, I was responsible for brainstorming and executing school service projects, representing
                                my club at divisional meetings, presiding over general meetings, overseeing the publication of at least eight newsletters, and
                                appointing/training committee heads. Our club was also chosen to host Fall Rally, which is the largest gathering of NJ Key Clubbers
                                at Six Flags, Great Adventure. As a club, we designed character signs for each of the twenty nine district board members, decorated
                                the park, created a themed spirit stick, and oversaw registration for the event. Who I am now, and to a large extent, who I will be
                                as a college student and beyond, all stems from the lessons I learned as a Key Clubber. </div>

                                express myself through aesthetically pleasing photos. Currently, I’m saving up for a DSLR and plan on taking a photography class
                                so I can approach photography in a more stylistic manner. </div>
